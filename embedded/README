The embedded target.

A series of transformation passes that convert a TouchDevelop script into a C++
program suitable for targeting embedded platforms. These are self-contained and
do not depend on the rest of the TouchDevelop codebase. There is a driver that
performs TouchDevelop-specific operations (e.g. load required libraries prior to
translating into C++); this driver is contained in [editor/embedded.ts].
